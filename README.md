I would like to thank [matteojug](https://github.com/matteojug) for large refactories of the code base, for polishing the ui a bit and for bending jython to register a Ghidra Plugin without using Java.

I also want to thank [pietroborrello](https://github.com/pietroborrello), [CristianRichie](https://github.com/CristianRichie) and [B4dSheeP](https://github.com/B4dSheeP) for testing the emulator.
