Hey, pull requests and issues are welcome!

So the project is organized in the following way
- src/emulator.py has the main stuff like initialization and executing commands
- src/lib/hooks.py has the magic to bridge the emulator state to c function parameters
- src/lib/__init__.py serves to expose new modules for hooking

Also if you want to register video tutorials on these topics we will be very grateful to you:
- installation and setup
- emulating a simple function
- solving a ctf challenge with the emulator

I will work on that as soon as I finish my BSc thesis in a two weeks
